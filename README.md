## ⚙️ Setup Instructions (Quick Start)

1. **Clone the Repo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shakeelkhuhro/ExampleCorp-Ecommerce.git
cd ExampleCorp-Ecommerce
````

2. **Run Locally with Docker Compose**

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

3. **Provision Infrastructure**

```bash
cd infra
terraform init
terraform apply
```

4. **Configure Server**

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory setup.yml
```

5. **Push Code for CI/CD**
   GitHub Actions will:

* Run tests
* Build Docker images
* Deploy to the server via SSH

---

## 📊 Key Metrics (Simulated)

* **Deployment Frequency**: Multiple times/day
* **Lead Time**: Hours instead of weeks
* **MTTR**: Reduced to minutes
* **Uptime**: 99.9% after monitoring setup

---

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

* Understand the full DevOps lifecycle
* Practice Infrastructure as Code and automation
* Build scalable, containerized applications
* Deploy real-world cloud-native apps with monitoring
